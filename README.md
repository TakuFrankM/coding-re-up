After a long hiatus from programming this repo is made to show my "training/re-familiarization" process from bare bones to where I used to be.

This repo will include basic - moderate concepts for my preferred languages and some that I'm currently learning (From hello world to algorithms and data structure practice as well as some framework refamiliarization)
