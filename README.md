After a long hiatus from programming this repo is made to show my "training/re-familiarization" process from bare bones 
to where I used to be.

This repo will include basic - moderate concepts in a collection of scripts style (monolith like) format.
Mainly focused on preferred languages, some that I'm currently learning and usage of their frameworks (From hello world 
to algorithms and data structure practice to framework re-familiarization)
